/// This is a union reader which contains multiple inner readers.

/// This reader, assembling multiple reader into one big and great reader. The row it produces
/// also come from the readers it contains.
///
/// For example, the expected schema for this reader is : int, int, string, int, string, int.(Total
/// 6 fields) It contains three inner readers, we call them reader0, reader1 and reader2.
///
/// The rowOffsets and fieldOffsets are all 6 elements long the same as
/// output schema. RowOffsets is used to indicate which inner reader the field comes from, and
/// fieldOffsets is used to indicate the offset of the field in the inner reader.
///
/// For example, if rowOffsets is {0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1} and fieldOffsets is {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0}, it
/// means:
/// - The first field comes from reader0, and it is at offset 0 in reader0.
/// - The second field comes from reader2, and it is at offset 0 in reader2.
/// - The third field comes from reader0, and it is at offset 1 in reader0.
/// - The fourth field comes from reader1, and it is at offset 1 in reader1.
/// - The fifth field comes from reader2, and it is at offset 1 in reader2.
/// - The sixth field comes from reader1, and it is at offset 0 in reader1.
///
/// These three readers work together, package out final and complete rows.
