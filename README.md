# Apache Paimon-cpp

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-4EB1BA.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

Paimon-cpp is the C++ implementation of [Apache Paimon](https://paimon.apache.org).
It provides native, high-performance, and extensible access to the Paimon lake format for C++ engines and services without JVM dependencies.

Background and documentation are available at [paimon.apache.org](https://paimon.apache.org).

## Status

Paimon-cpp is currently undergoing repository migration. The original repository is hosted at [github.com/alibaba/paimon-cpp](https://github.com/alibaba/paimon-cpp/), and the codebase is being migrated incrementally to the Apache Paimon community repository. 

## Features

Paimon-cpp currently provides:

- **Write**: append table and primary key table write support with compaction.
- **Commit**: append table commit support for simple append-only tables.
- **Scan**: batch and stream scan for append tables and primary key tables without changelog.
- **Read**: append table read, primary key table read with deletion vector, and primary key table merge-on-read.
- **Arrow integration**: batch read and write interfaces based on the [Arrow Columnar In-Memory Format](https://arrow.apache.org).
- **File systems**: file system abstraction with built-in local and Jindo file system support.
- **File formats**: file format abstraction with built-in ORC, Parquet, and Avro support.
- **Runtime utilities**: memory pool and thread pool abstractions with default implementations.
- **AI-Oriented Features**: supports RowTracking and DataEvolution mode and provides Global Index capabilities including bitmap index, B-tree index, DiskANN-based vector search with Lumina, and Lucene-based full-text search.
- **Compatibility**: compatibility with Apache Paimon Java format and communication protocols, including commit messages, data splits, and manifests.

The current implementation supports the `x86_64` architecture.

## Building

If you do not have `git-lfs` installed, install it first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/paimon-cpp.git
cd paimon-cpp
git lfs pull
```

Build with CMake:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
### Dev Containers

We provide Dev Container configuration file templates.

To use a Dev Container as your development environment, follow the steps below, then select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` from VS Code's Command Palette.

```
cd .devcontainer
cp Dockerfile.template Dockerfile
cp devcontainer.json.template devcontainer.json
```
